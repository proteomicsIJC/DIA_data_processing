# DIAN - data preprocessing
DIAN is a powerful free software that enables the DIA raw files tables extractions. The code/s that present in this repository have been created with the single purpose of facilitate the preprocessing of this kind of data in order to optimize the time a bioinformatician takes to preprocess data and being able to deliver biological meaningful results. 
The preprocessing script does the folowing actions in a __ manner:
- Data importation.
- Data transformations (log2 and median normalization)
- Raw quality metrics calculation and quality plots drawings.
- Missing values filtering/imputation.
- limma prepared datasets for futurable analysis.
- PCA plotting of the data.
Take in count that all the functions that are sourced in the scripts are attached in the [This is an external link to genome.gov](https://www.genome.gov/) repository.
